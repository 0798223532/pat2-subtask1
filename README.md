**A brief overview of what Morse Code is:**
Morse Code refers to either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and spaces.Morse code is a method of encoding text characters based on signal duration.

**The historical context of why Morse code was created:**
Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail
Around 1837, Morse therefore developed such a method, an early forerunner to the modern International Morse code. The Morse system for telegraphy, which was first used in about 1844, was designed to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents were received. Morse code was developed so that operators could translate the indentations marked on the paper tape into text messages. In his earliest design for a code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals, and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been sent.It was created to enable quick and efficient long-distance communication across places.

**An explanation of how the Morse code system works, including the use of dots and dashes:**
The duration of the dash is 3 times of dot. Each dot of dash is followed by the blank period which equals to the dot duration. Space between letters is 3 dots duration. Space between words is 7 dots duration.Morse Code uses an alphabet made up of dots and dashes (for instance, the letter "S" is three dots and "O" is three dashes.) To use it, one must tap the combination of dots and dashes needed and pause for the correct gap duration. There are longer gaps between words than letters in a word.Operation of Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information-carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves. The current or wave is present during the time period of the dit or dah and absent during the time between dits and dahs.
